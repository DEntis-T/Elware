# Elware
My "operating system" made in Batch and Visual Basic.

# Elware-Copy
`Elware-Copy` folder should be renamed to `Elware` in order to use.

# Fact
- I made this when I was in elementary school, I randomly found this source code on my disk which brang me a ton of memories. Hope you'll like it. I was also really boring with creating random and empty files (in fact I was obsessed in complicated stuff). :)
